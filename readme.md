# 🧪 QA Portfolio: Tank Filling Algorithm & Unit Testing

> **About this repository:** This project focuses on the foundation of the Agile Testing Pyramid: **Unit Testing**. It demonstrates how to validate core mathematical and logical algorithms (calculating time or operations required to fill a tank) using automated unit tests, static analysis, and continuous integration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a specialized JavaScript utility function designed to compute tank-filling metrics based on flow rates and capacity parameters (`src/fillTank.js`). 

As a **QA Automation Engineer**, my objective in this project is to ensure the algorithmic logic behaves predictably by writing and maintaining comprehensive unit tests (`src/fillTank.test.js`) that cover standard use cases, boundary values, and edge conditions directly at the code level.

## 🛠️ QA Tech Stack & Tools

* **Testing Level:** Unit Testing (White-Box Testing)
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions (Automated test execution on every push/PR)
* **Static Code Analysis (Shift-Left QA):** ESLint
* **Core Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📊 Test Strategy & Coverage

The testing strategy is engineered to isolate and tightly validate the algorithmic business logic:

### 1. Unit Testing (Code Level Validation)
Located in `src/fillTank.test.js`, the automated test suite verifies:
* Correct mathematical calculation of filling time/capacity under normal conditions.
* Robust handling of edge cases (e.g., zero flow rate, already full tanks, extreme capacities).
* Data integrity and deterministic return formats.

### 2. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
The project is seamlessly integrated with GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`). Every commit automatically triggers a pipeline that:
* Runs `ESLint` to catch syntax, logic, and style errors early in the development lifecycle.
* Executes the full unit test suite to prevent regressions from reaching production.

## 🚀 How to Run the Tests Locally

To evaluate the unit tests and static analysis tools on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository and install the required Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
